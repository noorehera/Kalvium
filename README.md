# Election Results Analysis

This Python script scrapes election results from a public URL, processes the data, and generates insightful analysis based on the election results. The data is then saved into a CSV file and a text file containing top insights. The script is intended to be run in **Google Colab**.

## Features

- **Fetch Election Data**: Scrapes election results from a specified URL using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Data Processing**: Converts the HTML table into a pandas DataFrame, cleans the data, and processes it for further analysis.
- **Insights Generation**: Generates insightful statistics based on the election results, including:
  - Total number of parties
  - Total number of constituencies
  - Leading party by seats
  - Second-major party by votes
  - Top 5 parties by seats
  - Potential coalition parties
  - Minor parties with 1 seat or less (excluding IND)
- **Download Results**: Provides the ability to download:
  - **CSV File**: Contains the raw election data.
  - **Text File**: Contains the top insights derived from the data.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required:

- `requests` - for fetching the webpage
- `beautifulsoup4` - for parsing HTML
- `pandas` - for processing and analyzing the election data
- `google.colab` - for file downloads in Google Colab

### Installing Dependencies

If running this script locally (not in Google Colab), you may need to install the required libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
